Building applications with real-time voice, video, and interaction are just plain hard. It is complex and it takes a lot of time to build.

Video SDK provides developers with simple-to-use, highly customisable, and widely compatible APIs to embed real-time video, voice, and interaction functionalities into their applications without the need to develop the technology or the underlying infrastructure for real-time engagement themselves.
