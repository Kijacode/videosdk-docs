This guide will help you to generate API key and secret from dashboard.

- **API Key** is unique identifier used to authenticate a user calling to Video SDK API.
- **Secret Key** cryptography relies on using the same key to encode and then later decode a message. Thus, only those who know the "secret" can read the message.

### Step 1. Generate API Key from Dashboard

Go to [Video SDK Dashboard](https://app.videosdk.live/), navigate to [<ins>**API Keys**</ins>](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys). Click on **ADD NEW** button to generate your own API key and Secret for the project.

### Step 3. Use API key / Secret or Token

After submitting your project name, you can follow either of two paths:

1. **Development Env:** You can just click on **Generate Token** and get started with the project setup.
2. **Production Env:** For production, please setup authentication server to authenticate and authorize all the users.
