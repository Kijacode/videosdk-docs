# Setup Authentication Server and Tokens


### Why we use token based Authentication ?

Token based authentication allow users to verify their identity by providing generated API key and secrets.

- Your server will generate access token using your API key and secret
- Your client obtains token from your backend server.
- For token validation, client will pass this token to VideoSDK.
- VideoSDK server will only allow entry in meeting if the token is valid.


To begin working with the VideoSDK, you need to setup a server that can authenticate & validate your API key and secret which we generated in the previous step. Follow this [Get your API key and Secret](signup-and-create-api) if you haven't generated API key and secret.

For server setup, you'll need the following APIs:

1. `GET` **get-token** : By providing API key and secret, this API will return accesstoken. We'll discuss in depth how to achieve it.

2. `POST` **create-meeting** : By providing generated access token, this API will return dash(-) separated meetingId, for example **abc-pqr-xyz**.

3. `POST` **validate-meeting/:meetingId** : By providing generated meetingId as a path parameter, this API will only validate the provided meetingId and return a `200 status`response. This API is for verification purpose only **[OPTIONAL]**.

:::note
You can integrate this APIs in client side also but we will suggest to use it at server side for better security.

### Generate Accees Token

To manage secured communication, every participant that connects to meeting needs a access token. By substituting `apikey` and `permissions` in it.
Follow our official example repositories to setup token API and meeting API, [videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples](https://github.com/videosdk-live/videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples)

Available permissions are:

- **allow_join**: The participant is **allowed to join** the meeting directly.
- **ask_join**: The participant requires to **ask for permission to join** the meeting.
- **allow_mod**: The participant is **allowed to toggle** webcam & mic of other participants.
