Everyone has their preferred social media platforms (Youtube, Facebook and Linkedin) and it can be difficult to get people across different platforms. With Restream your viewers can see live stream no matter what platform they use.

Here we have use Youtube platform as an example to let you understand how we can achieve restream feature.

:::note

We have assume that you had already enabled live streaming in your youtube account.
If not, you have to enable it by yourself and it will take approximately 24 hours to get enable.
